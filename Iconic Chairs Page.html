    <h1>"Iconic Chairs"</h1>
    <h2 class="po-h2">POSTER DESIGN</h2>
    <p>The "Iconic Chair Poster" serves as a promotional piece for an imaginative gallery exhibition showcasing the Butterfly Chair, a creation by Groupo Austral. The task at hand was to convey more than just a chair image; rather, it called for a visual interpretation of the chair's intricate design, functionality, and rich historical and cultural significance.
        </p>
    <p> In pursuit of this objective, I embarked on a journey into the realm of reductive abstraction, seeking to distill the chair's essence into a potent and universally resonant message. The resulting poster design draws inspiration from the typography and nostalgic ambiance of the 1930s, the very era when the chair was originally conceived.
