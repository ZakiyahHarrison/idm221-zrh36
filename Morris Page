    <h1>Morris Animal Refuge</h1>
    <h2>Brand Identity Project</h2>

    <p>
        Morris Animal Refuge, a dedicated and historical pet refuge is rooted in Philadelphia. They are deeply committed to adoption, education, and providing top-notch care, all with the overarching objective of securing positive and compassionate outcomes for animals in distress. 
        </p>
    <p>
        When tasked with redesigning their logo, my primary aim was to convey a sense of warmth, playfulness, and most importantly community. I aimed to create a visual identity that stands in contrast to the somber and disheartening imagery often associated with animal refuges.
