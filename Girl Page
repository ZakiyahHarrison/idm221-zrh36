    <h1>Girl</h1>
    <h2>Typographry Project</h2>

    <p>In Jamaica Kincaid's short story "Girl," a mother imparts a series of terse yet instructive sentences to her daughter, offering guidance on how to navigate the complexities of life as a woman. Through this poignant exchange, the story explores the themes of maturation, gender roles, and the transmission of cultural values within a mother-daughter relationship. This project reflects this sentiment through visual distortion and repetition to enforce the nature of the story.
