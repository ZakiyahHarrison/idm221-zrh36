## My Designer Side

Hi there! I’m Zakiyah, a Philadelphia-based student currently studying at Drexel University and expected to graduate in June of 2024. Majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Interactive Digital Media, I’m very passionate about design and its impact on everything around us.

One of my strengths as a designer is my intentionality. When it comes to my designs, I’m very deliberate; each color, layout, typeface, and every detail in between has a reason behind it. As a graphic designer’s job is to communicate with others and solve problems, maneuvering through the many methods to find the most successful solutions is what I enjoy the most.
