## My Fine Art Side
After having taken many courses at the Moore School of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts over many years, it would be a disservice to only label myself as a designer. Though I’m pursuing my degree in Graphic Design, I thank the fine arts to being the beginning of my creative journey. I seek out many materials, a recent one being wood. My portfolio mainly consists of paintings though I dabble in figure drawings as well. I accept commissions for artwork, as I believe I’m also able to evoke emotion in a beautiful way through my paintings.
