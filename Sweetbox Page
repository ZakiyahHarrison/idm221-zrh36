    <h1>Sweetbox Bakery</h1>
    <h2>Brand Identity Project</h2>
    <p>Sweetbox Bakeshop is a thriving bakery nestled in the heart of Philadelphia, proudly woman-owned and committed to crafting a delightful atmosphere for all to savor a diverse array of delectable baked treats.</p>
    <p>Given their current lack of a distinct brand identity, my strategy involved a comprehensive rebranding effort, aimed at revitalizing Sweetbox. Our goal was to craft an inviting and lighthearted logo and establish a unified visual language that truly embodies the essence of Sweetbox Bakeshop.</p>
